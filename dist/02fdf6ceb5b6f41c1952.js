It is the first and only restaurant in Canada with a two\n    Michelin-starred chef. Chef Masaki Saito, raised in Hokkaido and\n    trained in Tokyo, focuses on the purity and source of his ingredients,\n    and showcases his respect for Edomae tradition in evolution with his\n    own unique imagination.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Tucked into a cozy Victorian building in Yorkville, Sushi Masaki Saito\n    reveals the tradition and atmosphere of Gion, Kyoto or an Old\n    Edo-style neighbourhood in Tokyo. Every detail serves the aim of\n    authenticity, including a 200-year old Hinoki dining counter imported\n    from Nara, Japan that is surrounded by a harmony of traditional\n    Japanese handcrafted d√©cor and local Ontario marble and limestone.\n  </p>\n</div>')}export{addHomepage};
